# Supply-Chain-Analysis-Dashboard


## Problem Statement
In today's competitive business landscape, effective supply chain management is crucial for maximizing revenue, minimizing costs, and ensuring smooth operations. Many organizations struggle with fragmented data, making it difficult to gain insights into revenue streams, stock levels, customer demographics, and product performance. Without a well-structured dashboard, decision-makers often rely on scattered reports, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.


## Objectives
This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain by:
1. Visualizing total revenue, total products sold, total costs, stock levels, and profit margins.
2. Analyzing revenue distribution across product types, SKUs, and customer demographics.
3. Assessing revenue contributions from different shipping carriers.
4. Identifying product defect rates to improve quality control and reduce losses.
5. Evaluating supplier performance based on profit margins.
6. Enhancing decision-making by providing clear and actionable insights.


## Data Methods and Tools
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this dashboard was sourced from Excel files containing records of product sales, customer demographics, shipping performance, and supplier details.
- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned in Microsoft Excel to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize formats for better visualization.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Power BI was used to develop the interactive dashboard, integrating various data visualizations to provide meaningful insights.


## Key Insights
1. **Revenue Distribution:**
   - The total revenue generated stands at **$578K**, with **46,099 products sold**.
   - Skincare products contribute the highest revenue, followed by haircare and cosmetics.
   - The highest revenue-generating SKUs include **SKU51, SKU38, and SKU31**, all generating around **$9.7K**.

2. **Customer Demographics:**
   - The majority of purchases are made by **female customers (29.97%)**, while male and non-binary customers account for **27.96%** and **21.92%**, respectively.
   - A significant portion of the customers remain unidentified, indicating a need for improved customer data collection.

3. **Shipping Performance:**
   - Carrier B contributed the highest revenue ($0.25M), while Carrier A and Carrier C followed with $0.14M and $0.18M, respectively.

4. **Product Defect Rates:**
   - Cosmetics have the highest defect rate at **36.86%**, followed by skincare at **34.65%** and haircare at **28.49%**.
   - High defect rates suggest quality control improvements are necessary to reduce product wastage and customer dissatisfaction.

5. **Supplier Performance:**
   - Supplier 3 had the highest average profit margin (**91.08%**), whereas Supplier 2 also performed well at **87.24%**.
   - Suppliers 1 and 4 had similar performance with an average profit margin of **84.16% and 84.11%**, respectively.
   - Optimizing supplier contracts could improve cost efficiency and profit margins.


## Recommendations
- The team suggested improving data collection on customer demographics to enhance targeted marketing strategies.
- Given the high defect rates in cosmetics and skincare, it was recommended to enhance quality control measures, perform supplier audits, and implement stricter manufacturing standards.
- The report advised reassessing supplier contracts, negotiating better terms, and prioritizing high-performing suppliers to maximize profit margins.
- The analysis pointed out that Carrier B generated the highest revenue, indicating a need to explore partnerships with them for better cost efficiency and reliability.
- The dashboard revealed stock levels at **4,777 units**, and it was recommended to implement better inventory forecasting models to avoid overstocking or stockouts.


## Inspiration
This dashboard was inspired by the work of Chiamaka Igwe and was recreated to enhance supply chain data visualization and decision-making.
